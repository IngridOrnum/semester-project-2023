## Requirements
The semester project have the following requirements:

1. The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
2. The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
3. Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
4. Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
5. The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
6. The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most
200kb.
7. The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation,
and colour usage.
8. The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
9. The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of
meta tags and alt text).

## Features
The project features six responsive page. These are the following:
- Homepage: animated hero, navigation buttons and the option to join newsletter.
- Exhibitions overview page: an overview of all the exhibitions avaliable on the science museum.
- Cosmology exhibition: a description of one of the exhibitions, cosmology exhibition, with more images.
- Events overview page: an overview of future events avaliable on the science museum.
- Plan your visit: an informative page about opening hours, contact informationm and adress. It also includes information about admission, guided tours, accessibility and food/drink/shop.
- About page: short description of the museum, including the museums values. Dropdown content of support, volunteer and internship. Option to join newsletter.

## Technical specifications

### Tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript: I used Javascript to create the burger menu in the header and dropdown content in the "about page".

### Tools used
- Figma: I used figma to design the entire project. 
- Webstorm: the code editing software I used.
- Github: I github board and roadmap to keep a structured work flow. I also used Github to commit and merge to main branch.
- Sourcetree: Git version control was managed using Sourcetree.
- Webp Converter: I downloaded and used this tool to compress images to under 200kb, from jpeg to webp.
- Bing AI image generator: I used this image generator to use images more specific and suitable to the website I made.[Link to Bing image generator](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GDPGLP)
- Unsplashed: I used free images from Unsplashed, and credited the owner on my figma file.
- Fontawesome: Most of the icons used on the page is from [Fontawesome.](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- Flaticon: Some icons used on the page is from [Flaticon.](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Notion: I used Notion, a web application for taking notes.

### Deployment 
I used Vercel to deploy my project. [Click here to go to the project.](https://semester-project-2023.vercel.app/)
  
## Process
The process of planning the project started in Notion, github board and github roadmap because I already was familiar with these tools.

### Design process
The first week I planned the project by create pencil sketches of each site, then I did mid-fi wireframes in figma. I also used Notion to write down ideas and reflect on the target audience. In the second week I created my design in figma, where I also declarired color-scheme, font-famliies, gaps and sizes. However, in the end of the week I decided to change all of my design. The reason for this was that I wanted more lighter and childlike colors used in my website. Because of this I was some days behind the dates I had set for myself in the roadmap I created. In total I used about two weeks designing the project. I also did some changes in the design, like swaping photos and adding a new font for h1-headings while coding.

I found most of my images on unsplashed, searching for images related to science, museum, children, etc.

### Production process
I used sourcetree to set up the project and create branches locally on my mac. While working on the code, I regularly committed changes and pushed to Github. When finished with a branch, I merged with the main branch and pulled the changes to the main branch locally on my computer using sourcetree. 

I started creating the header and the footer, but I didn't complete the burger menu in the header until quite late in the work process because this required javascript and I wanted to prioritize to finish the design. I then created the the content on each page. I added all repeating styles in the "style.css" style-sheet, like gaps, font sizes, button styles, etc. 

## Reflection
I am not satisfied with the design I ended up with, even though I already changed it one time. I had many ideas of how the page could look like, but was split between a minamalistic og a maximalistic design.

I also aren't too happy with the work process with the branches, because I merged some of the pages before being completely done with the page. This resulted in some awkward and messy branches, ex: "about-page-fix". If I could do it again, I would make even more detailed issues on the github board for each page.
