# Community Science Museum - Semester Project


## Project Description
This webpage serves as the online presence for the fictional "Community Science Museum". The page aims to engage visitors by promoting upcoming events and providing previews of current exhibitions. Users can find essential information such as the museum's location, opening hours, contact details, and admission fees.

This project was the first semester project while studying front-end development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## Requirements
The semester project have the following requirements:

1. The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
2. The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
3. Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
4. Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
5. The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
6. The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most
200kb.
7. The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation,
and colour usage.
8. The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
9. The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of

## Features
The website has six responsive pages, with the following features:
- <strong>Homepage:</strong> animated hero, navigation buttons and the option to join a newsletter.
- <strong>Exhibitions overview page:</strong> an overview of all the exhibitions avaliable on the science museum.
- <strong>Cosmology exhibition:</strong> a description of one of the exhibitions, cosmology exhibition, with more images.
- <strong>Events overview page:</strong> an overview of future events avaliable on the science museum.
- <strong>Plan your visit:</strong> an informative page about opening hours, contact informationm and adress. It also includes information about admission, guided tours, accessibility and food/drink/shop.

### Tools
- Figma: I used figma to design the entire project. 
- Webstorm: the code editing software I used.
- Github: I github board and roadmap to keep a structured work flow. I also used Github to commit and merge to main branch.
- Sourcetree: Git version control was managed using Sourcetree.
- Webp Converter: I downloaded and used this tool to compress images to under 200kb, from jpeg to webp.
- Bing AI image generator: I used this image generator to use images more specific and suitable to the website I made.[Link to Bing image generator](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GDPGLP)
- Unsplashed: I used free images from Unsplashed, and credited the owner on my figma file.
- Fontawesome: Most of the icons used on the page is from [Fontawesome.](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- Flaticon: Some icons used on the page is from [Flaticon.](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Notion: I used Notion, a web application for taking notes.
  
## Process
The process of planning the project started in Notion, github board and github roadmap because I already was familiar with these tools.

### Design process
The first week I planned the project by create pencil sketches of each site. Then I did mid-fi wireframes in figma. I also used Notion to write down ideas and reflect on the target audience. In the second week I created my design in figma, where I also decided on color-scheme, font-famliies, gaps and sizes. However, in the end of the week I decided to change most of my design. The reason for this was that I wanted more lighter and childlike colors to be used in my website, for a better fit for the target audience.

I found most of my images on unsplashed, searching for images related to science, museum, children, etc.

### Production process
I used sourcetree to set up the project and create branches locally on my mac. While working on the code, I regularly committed changes and pushed to Github. When finished with a branch, I merged with the main branch and pulled the changes to the main branch locally on my computer using sourcetree. 

## Reflection
I had some difficulty deciding on design. I had many ideas of how the page could look like, but was split between a minamalistic og a maximalistic design.

I had some trouble with the work process related to branches in sourcetree, because I by mistake merged some of the branches before being completely done with the page. This resulted what can look like a messy workflow. As a result of this I learned that I must make even more detailed issues on the github board for each page.
