# Community Science Museum - Semester Project


## Project Description
This webpage serves as the online presence for the fictional "Community Science Museum". The project aims to engage visitors by promoting upcoming events and providing previews of current exhibitions. Users can find essential information such as the museum's location, opening hours, contact details, and admission fees. The website features playful colours designed to intrigue the target audience - children. 

This project was the first semester project while studying front-end development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

### 4.2 Tools
- Figma: I used figma to design the entire project. 
- Webstorm: the code editing software I used.
- Github: I github board and roadmap to keep a structured work flow. I also used Github to commit and merge to main branch.
- Sourcetree: Git version control was managed using Sourcetree.
- Webp Converter: I downloaded and used this tool to compress images to under 200kb, from jpeg to webp.
- Bing AI image generator: I used this image generator to use images more specific and suitable to the website I made.[Link to Bing image generator](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GDPGLP)
- Unsplashed: I used free images from Unsplashed, and credited the owner on my figma file.
- Fontawesome: Most of the icons used on the page is from [Fontawesome.](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- Flaticon: Some icons used on the page is from [Flaticon.](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Notion: I used Notion, a web application for taking notes.

## 5. Challenges
I had some difficulty deciding on design. I had many ideas regarding the design, but was split between a minimalistic og a more maximalistic design. I ended up with a design with more colours and childlike design with the target audience in mind, which were children.

I also had some trouble with the work process related to branches in SourceTree, because I by mistake merged some of the branches before being completely done with the issue. This resulted in what can look like a messy workflow. As a result of this I learned that I must make even more detailed issues on the GitHub board for each page. 

## 6. Licence
This project is licenced under the MIT Licence.
